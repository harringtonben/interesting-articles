		<h1>Trump 1</h1>
			<p>We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!</p>

		<h1>Trump 2</h1>
			<p>An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.</p>

		<h1>Trump 3</h1>
			<p>I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>

		<h1>Trump 4</h1>
			<p>An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!</p>
